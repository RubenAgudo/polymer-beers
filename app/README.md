# ![](/img/logo-25px.png) Polymer Beers - Polymer tutorial - Step 01


This is the initial step of the tutorial. In this step you won't need to code, everything is already coded for you.

Remember, to see the app running in a browser, open a separate terminal/command line tab or window, go to the project directory and then run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` or `node ./scripts/web-server.js` to start the web server. Now, open a browser window for the app and navigate to http://localhost:8000/app/ to see the current state of the app.

In order to illustrate how Polymer enhances standard HTML, you will create a purely static HTML page and then examine how we can turn this HTML code into a template that Polymer will use to dynamically display the same result with any set of data.

In this step you will add some basic information about two beers to an HTML page.

## The structure of the app ##

As you can see, the `app` directory have several sub-directories:

* `beers`: a service endpoint with all the information about our beer collection. It will be used in the later steps of the tutorial.
* `css`: the stylesheets for the app.
* `elements`: here you will find the definition of the custom Polymer elements used in the tutorial

## Dependencies

To simplify third-party dependencies management, a custom `.bowerrc` file is used to ensure that both the application version in `app` folder and the solutions in the `step-XX` folders use the same `bower_components` folder at the root of the project.

All the dependencies have been included in the git repository to be able to run the tutorial fully offline.

## What must I do? ##

Add the beer information to the `app/index.html` file:


    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Affligem Blond</span>
        <p>
          Affligem Blonde, the classic clear blonde abbey ale, with a gentle roundness and 6.8% alcohol.
          Low on bitterness, it is eminently drinkable.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Affligem Tripel</span>
        <p>
          The king of the abbey beers. It is amber-gold and pours with a deep head and original aroma,
          delivering a complex, full bodied flavour. Pure enjoyment! Secondary fermentation in the bottle.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

## Additional experiments ##

Try adding more static HTML to `app/index.html`. For example:


    <p>Total number of beers: 2</p>

## Summary

We have done an app skeleton for a beers app. To begin adding dynamism, go to [step-02](../step-02).
